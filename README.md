# EOS-ERR-1603-fix
This is only a original Epic Online Services to somehow fix when you get EOS-ERR-1603 error code

To install it, put the attached file to "C:\Program Files (x86)\Epic Games\Epic Online Services". create the folder if it isnt there.

After you put the file to location, install the EOS from Epic Games Store, then you'll get a notification indicates EOS successfully installed.

The file may outdated.
